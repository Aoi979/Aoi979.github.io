Welcome. This site is mainly for storing notes, technical records,
and some unstructured thoughts worth preserving.

## About Me

I am currently focused on systems, high-performance computing (HPC),
and AI operators, studying GPU architectures, CUDA / PTX,
and some low-level software system design.

This site mainly serves as a collection of learning notes.
The content may be incomplete or immature, but accuracy is always the priority.
